Q1. Rules for naming variables in C
✅ Rules for valid variable names in C:
Must begin with a letter (A-Z or a-z) or underscore _.

Can contain letters, digits (0-9), and underscore _.

Cannot begin with a digit.

Cannot be a reserved keyword (like int, register, etc.).

Case sensitive (Age and age are different).

Given Variables:
2you ❌ (Starts with a digit – invalid)

bookid ✅ (Valid)

_refnum ✅ (Valid, starts with underscore)

b2b ✅ (Valid)

register ❌ (Reserved keyword in C)

Correct variables and renamed examples:
bookid → ✅ keep as is

_refnum → ✅ keep as is

b2b → ✅ keep as is

Rename 2you → you2 or two_you

Rename register → reg1 or regValue
