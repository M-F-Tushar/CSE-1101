Q1: Differentiate while() loop from do...while() loop.
Answer:

Feature	    while() Loop	                                do...while() Loop
Condition   check	At the beginning	                    At the end
Execution   guarantee	                                    May not execute even once if condition is false	Executes at least once
Syntax	    while(condition) { code }	                    do { //code } while(condition);
Use Case	When pre-check is needed before execution	    When at least one execution is needed
