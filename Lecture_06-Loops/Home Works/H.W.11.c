//Write a program that reads a positive integer and displays the maximum positive integer n for which the sum 1 to the power 2 + 2 to the power 2 + 3 to the power 2 + ... + n2 is less than the given number.

/*
ðŸ“Š Why i - 1?
Letâ€™s say num = 30

Step-by-step:


i	i*i	sum
1	1	1
2	4	5
3	9	14
4	16	30 â†’ condition met, loop breaks
At this point, sum = 30 and i = 4

The loop just broke, but sum became equal to or more than num

So, the last i before this happened was 3

Hence, i - 1 = 3 is the last number for which the sum was still less than num
